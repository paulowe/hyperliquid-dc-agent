# DC Overshoot Strategy - BTC on Hyperliquid Testnet
#
# Model-free strategy exploiting DC theory heuristic:
# After a Directional Change confirmation (PDCC event), price tends to
# overshoot in the same direction by approximately the same threshold.
#
# Entry rules:
#   PDCC_Down (downward confirmation) → SHORT
#   PDCC2_UP  (upward confirmation)   → LONG
#
# Risk management uses "greedy trailing":
#   - When in loss: SL and TP remain at initial levels
#   - When in profit: SL ratchets toward profit (locks in gains),
#     TP pushes further in profit direction (lets winners run)
