# Experiment 003: Data Volume Only (no architecture changes)
# Pipeline: dc-ablation-pipeline
# Run ID: dc-ablation-pipeline-20260218023921
# Date: 2026-02-18
#
# Hypothesis: v2's catastrophic failure was caused by the bottleneck + regularization,
# NOT by the increased data volume. This experiment uses the SAME 3-month data as v2
# but the SAME architecture as v1 (no bottleneck, no dropout, no L2).
# If baseline recovers to R²>0, bottleneck was the problem.

  note: Data processing steps (extract, DC detect, feature eng, split, window, concat) should cache from v2 run since inputs are identical. Only training + comparison re-run.
