# Experiment 014: Threshold=0.005 with Full Determinism

## Question
Is the DA=55.8% result from exp 011 (threshold=0.005) reproducible with deterministic training?

## Changes from 013
- single_dc_threshold=0.005 (was 0.001)

## Key Comparisons
- **DA**: Exp 011 single-DC DA=55.8% — is it reproducible?
- **Baseline DA**: Exp 013 baseline DA=44.1% — is it threshold-independent?
- **DC R²**: Exp 013 single-DC R²=0.039 with 0.001 — does 0.005 change this?
