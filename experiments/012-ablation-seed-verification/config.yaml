# Experiment 012: Seed Verification (re-run exp 005 config with random_seed=42)
# Pipeline: dc-ablation-pipeline
# Date: 2026-02-19
#
# Re-runs exp 005 configuration (threshold=0.001, shift=50, bottleneck=128)
# with random_seed=42 for reproducibility verification.
#
# Goals:
# 1. Verify R² stability: exp 005 got R²=0.871 baseline, exp 011 got R²=0.198
#    with identical architecture. Does seed control fix this?
# 2. Get reference_price directional accuracy for threshold=0.001 (not available in exp 005)
# 3. Establish a reproducible baseline for future experiments
#
# Changes from exp 011:
# - single_dc_threshold=0.001 (was 0.005 in exp 011)
# - random_seed=42 added to hparams (NEW — first seeded experiment)
# - Training caching disabled (force re-train with new seed)
