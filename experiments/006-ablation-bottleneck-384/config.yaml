# Experiment 006: Matched Compression Ratio for Multi-DC
# Pipeline: dc-ablation-pipeline
# Date: 2026-02-18
#
# Hypothesis: If single-DC succeeds at 72% compression (450->128 in exp 005),
# then multi-DC should succeed at the same 72% compression (1350->384).
# If multi-DC still fails, the extra DC thresholds add noise, not signal.
#
# Compression ratios at bottleneck=384:
#   Baseline:  50*3  = 150 -> 384 (expansion, 0% loss)
#   Single-DC: 50*9  = 450 -> 384 (mild, 15% loss)
#   Multi-DC:  50*27 = 1350 -> 384 (moderate, 72% loss - matching single-DC in exp 005)
