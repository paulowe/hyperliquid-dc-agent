# Experiment 005: Larger Bottleneck (128 dims) for Fair Capacity Comparison
# Pipeline: dc-ablation-pipeline
# Run ID: dc-ablation-pipeline-20260218050234
# Date: 2026-02-18
#
# Hypothesis: A 128-dim bottleneck preserves most temporal info for baseline
# (150->128 = 15% compression) while significantly constraining multi-DC
# (1350->128 = 90% compression). If multi-DC still fails, DC features are noise.
#
# Flattened dims:
#   Baseline:  50*3  = 150 -> 128 (mild, 15% loss)
#   Single-DC: 50*9  = 450 -> 128 (moderate, 72% loss)
#   Multi-DC:  50*27 = 1350 -> 128 (aggressive, 90% loss)
