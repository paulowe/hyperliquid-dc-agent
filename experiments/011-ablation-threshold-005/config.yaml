# Experiment 011: DC Threshold Sweep (threshold=0.005)
# Pipeline: dc-ablation-pipeline
# Date: 2026-02-19
#
# First experiment in DC threshold sweep.
# Tests whether a larger DC threshold (0.005 = 0.5% price change)
# produces better regime signals than the current 0.001 (0.1%).
#
# Larger thresholds mean:
# - Fewer DC events (only triggered by 0.5% price moves)
# - More meaningful regime changes (stronger signal)
# - Potentially less noisy features
#
# Baseline and multi-DC arms should cache from exp 005 (same shift=50,
# bottleneck=128). Only single-DC arm re-runs with new threshold.
