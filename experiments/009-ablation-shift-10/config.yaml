# Experiment 009: Prediction Horizon (shift=10)
# Pipeline: dc-ablation-pipeline
# Date: 2026-02-19
#
# First experiment in prediction horizon sweep.
# Tests whether a shorter prediction gap improves forecasting
# and changes the relative value of DC features.
#
# Previous experiments used shift=50 (gap of 50 ticks between
# input window end and prediction target). This tests shift=10.
#
# Windowing semantics:
#   input:  ticks[0..49]  (50 ticks)
#   gap:    ticks[50..59] (10 ticks, ignored)
#   label:  tick[60]      (1 tick, PRICE_std)
#
# Cache impact: DC detection, feature engineering, splitting all CACHED.
# Only windowing, training, and comparison re-run.
