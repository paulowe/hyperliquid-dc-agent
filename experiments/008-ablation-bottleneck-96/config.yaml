# Experiment 008: Bottleneck Midpoint (96)
# Pipeline: dc-ablation-pipeline
# Run ID: dc-ablation-pipeline-20260218133338
# Date: 2026-02-18
#
# Tests midpoint between 64 (too tight, exp 007) and 128 (optimal, exp 005)
# to refine the optimal bottleneck dimension.
#
# Compression ratios at bottleneck=96:
#   Baseline:  50*3  = 150 -> 96 (36% compression)
#   Single-DC: 50*9  = 450 -> 96 (79% compression)
#   Multi-DC:  50*27 = 1350 -> 96 (93% compression)
